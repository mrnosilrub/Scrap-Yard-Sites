# Standard-Launch-Demo 2

This demo mirrors the styling from Demo 1 and now shares its title and logo.

## Assets

All images and downloadable files referenced by the HTML pages live in the `assets/` directory unless otherwise noted.

The site currently expects the following assets:

- `../demo-yard-1/assets/logo.svg` – shared logo used for the favicon and navigation bar.
- `../demo-yard-1/assets/logo.png` – PNG fallback for the favicon.
- `assets/hero.jpg` – hero image used on both pages.

Image files are not tracked in version control. Ensure any additional images or documents are saved in the `assets/` folder and referenced by their relative path.
