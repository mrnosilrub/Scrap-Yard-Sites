# Power-Launch Demo

This repository contains a static demo website for a fictional scrapyard called **Demo Yard**. Open `index.html` in a browser to explore the landing page and navigate to other pages like Services.

All styles and behavior are implemented with Tailwind CSS and small JavaScript helpers in `script.js`.
