# Scrap-Yard-Sites

This repo includes a single-page marketing site template. Add your hero image to `assets/hero.jpg`.

For social previews, you can also include a JPG thumbnail at `assets/thumbnail.jpg`.

## Blog Posts

1. Create a new file under `blog/posts/` by copying `blog/post-template.html` and renaming it with your desired slug (e.g. `my-new-post.html`).
2. Edit the new file and update the `<title>`, hero image, category label, author, date and body content.
3. On `blog/index.html` add a new `<article class="blog-card">` entry linking to your slug so the post appears on the blog home page.
4. Update both the card heading link and the "Read more" link to point to `/blog/posts/your-slug.html`.

Following this process keeps posts organized and ensures the header and footer remain consistent across the site.
